   - Skills: Functions, input/output, basic pattern matching.

3. **To-Do List**
   - Overview: Create a command-line to-do list application where users can add, delete, and list tasks.
   - Skills: Lists, data types, basic I/O, error handling.

4. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Overview: Develop a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
   - Skills: String manipulation, recursion, conditionals.

5. **Prime Number Generator**
   - Overview: Write a program that generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.
   - Skills: Functional programming concepts (e.g., filtering, recursion), algorithmic thinking.

6. **File Encryption/Decryption**
   - Overview: Implement a simple file encryption and decryption tool using a basic algorithm like Caesar cipher.
   - Skills: File I/O, higher-order functions, cryptography basics.

7. **Chat Application**
